# Surreal Robotics Suite Panda Robot with IK control

This project is built on top of [Surreal Robotics Suite (Robosuite)](<https://github.com/StanfordVL/robosuite>) and [our previous work](<https://github.com/eugval/sim2real_dynamics_simulation>). You need to install necessary packages in both above projects. This project enables Panda robot with inverse kinematics control.



## Quick Start
